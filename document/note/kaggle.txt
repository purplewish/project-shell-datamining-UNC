=Project goal:
Apply machine learning techniques to identify sweetspots(top quartile most productive areas) in a play with limited amount of geological data (subsurface factors).


=Data
1.Collected in 2012 - 2013
2.Geological data (Core + Log) [as input to build the model]
3.Production data [train and test the model]
4.Completion data [as controls on production]
5.Extrapolation and smoothing

2.Geological data
-Core (83 wells) from CoreLabs
--Geochemical Analysis (19 fields)
--RCA (29 fields)
--SCAL (43 fields)
--Shale Gas Analysis (246 fields)

-Log
--IHS(444 wells)
--CoreLabs(71 wells)
**Note: Log data reliability IHS < CoreLabs

3.Production data (5814 wells UWI#)
-From IHS
--Filter criteria
---Producing Zone=Eagle Ford
---Production began after Jan 2008

4.Completion data (5513 wells)
-Filter criteria (same as above)
-Data were sparse. 
--e.g. 38% has lateral length, 40% has # of frac stages.

5.Extrapolation and smoothing (Geographical features) (57 core well features and 38 well log features)
-Basic interpolation
--Kriging + kernel density estimation
---Kriging is more accurate and prefered
---Kernel density estimation will be used only when kriging failed but geographical correlation existed
---Ensembles of kriging performed on subsamples of data were used when the number of data points would have slowed the procedure

-Advanced interpolation
--Core well and well log features are merged into a single geological feature dataset
--The features in this geological dataset are interpolated to fill in missing value and separately added onto the well dataset
--First-pass feature predictions are generated on the well dataset, using random forests trained on the geological dataset
--Out-of-bag features predictions are generated for the geological dataset using random forests and multiple train/test splits
--The residual of these out-of-bag predictions is interpolated onto the well dataset and used to refine the first-pass feature predictions.

*Note: 
--Details for geographical interpolation are in section 3.2 of Kaggle phase-1 report.
--Kaggle spend >6 weeks on data cleanup and pre-processing


=Random forest model
-Split into random training and test data sets
--The wells used to train the model are geographically separated from the test wells
-Each producer(5814) was tagged with its nearest cored well
--when create a test-train split, all producer wells tagged to a specific cored well are assigned to the same split
-Using extrapolated maps from log+core features, a RF was created for each of the 5814 production wells.

=Results
1.Variable importance chart 
-for oil production (Geological + completion parameters)
-for gas production (Geological + completion parameters)
2.Identify top quartile producer given extrapolated geological data
-True+
-false+
-false-
3.Time accelaeration over a standard benchmark, which is krigged production.
